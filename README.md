Let me break down and explain each of these errors in a clear way:

### 1. Chrome Extension Message Error
```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
```
- **Meaning**: This occurs in Chrome extensions when a message listener promises to respond later (`return true`), but the connection closes before the response is sent.
- **Fix**: Ensure your extension's message handlers either respond immediately or maintain the message port open until ready to respond.

### 2. Local API Connection Error
```
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
localhost:5000/api-key:1
Error fetching API key: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```
- **Meaning**: Your app tried to connect to `localhost:5000` to get an API key but couldn't (server not running/wrong port).
- **Fix**:
  - Ensure your local API server is running
  - Check the correct port (5000)
  - If developing locally, verify CORS settings

### 3. OpenWeatherMap API Errors (Multiple 401 Unauthorized)
```
api.openweathermap.org/... 401 (Unauthorized)
Error fetching weather data: Request failed with status code 401
```
- **Meaning**: Your requests to OpenWeatherMap are missing or have an invalid API key.
- **Root Cause**: The requests show URLs ending with `appid=` (empty API key)
- **Fix**:
  1. Get a valid API key from OpenWeatherMap
  2. Properly include it in requests: `&appid=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY`
  3. If storing keys server-side, ensure your local API (`localhost:5000`) is properly providing them

### Key Problems Identified:
1. **API Key Missing**: All weather API requests fail because no API key is being sent
2. **Local Server Down**: The app tries to get the API key from a local server that's not responding
3. **Extension Issue**: Separate Chrome extension messaging problem

### Recommended Solutions:
1. For the weather app:
   - Hardcode a valid OpenWeatherMap API key temporarily for testing
   - Or fix your local API server to properly provide the key
   - Ensure requests include: `&appid=your_real_key_here`

2. For the extension error:
   - Review your extension's message passing architecture
   - Ensure all promised responses are delivered before ports close

3. For the local API:
   - Start your server on port 5000
   - Verify the `/api-key` endpoint works by visiting it directly in your browser
   - Check for CORS issues if requests are cross-origin

The core issue appears to be authentication failures due to missing API keys throughout your application's chain of requests.
